# Machine_Learning_Assignment_4
This assigment that I did during a course I am taking is about Data Cleasning and how to use our dataset to prepare it to be a better dataset to our model.

The first two questions are not important, because they are for my identity.

The third question talks about Data cleaning, while using many various ways to clean it, by using drop functions, catching outliers in our dataset using IQR calculation, scaling our dataset through MinMaxScale, filling our dataset where there NaN and finding correlation with pearson correlation to set our dataset to be better for our model before we train it.

The fourth question is talking about training our model, which yet on our course we've learned KNN, Guassain Bayes and Decision Tree models.

The fifth question is talking about making functions to calculate our accuracy, once with accuracy score, and second with cross validation accuracy.

The sixth question is talking about making functions that can evaluate which hyperparameters are better for our model, by using different kinds of paramters according the question being asked.
